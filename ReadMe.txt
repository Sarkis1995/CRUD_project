This is a personal project to play around with.

npm install to get all dependencies

make a .env file with PORT = 3000 for the app.listen function 
For the env file also add DB_STRING = 'database link'

I am going to turn this app into a website that allows me to add all the resturants that I have visted and make lists and organize them.
Should probably look into Yelps API so I can pull info about resturants from there
